## BBSE Bank
BBSEBank is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to earn interest by depositing Ether.
The interest is calculated based on a pre-defined yearly return rate. Although the users can withdraw their
Ether back anytime they want, the longer the deposit stays, the more interest they earn. The interest is paid
back not in Ether, but in the form of BBSE token which is an ERC20 token.
